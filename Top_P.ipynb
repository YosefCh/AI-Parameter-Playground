    "## LLM models choose words in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model starts with a seed word.\n",
    "2. Once there is a first word, the model iterates through its entire vocabulary to find all the words that can follow which are grammatically correct and contextually relevant.\n",
    "3. The model then sorts the list in descending order of probability (which gives us the most probable words at the beginning of the list).\n",
    "4. The size of this list will depend on the **`top_p` value**. If, for example, the value is 1, the entire set of possible words is considered. If the value is 0.9, the model will consider the top 90% of the words, and so on. This means that the smaller the value of `top_p`, the smaller the list of possible words.\n",
    "5. The probabilities of each word are then summed as a *running total* until the total reaches or exceeds the `top_p` value.\n",
    "6. The subsequent words in the list are then discarded.\n",
    "7. The model then randomly selects a word from the list of words that have been selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can be learned from this is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lower `top_p` value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small Sample Size:** When `top_p` is low (e.g., 0.1), the model only considers the top 10% of the most probable words.\n",
    "- **Quick Cumulative Probability Threshold:** Within this small sample, the cumulative probability threshold (e.g., 0.1) is reached quickly. This means that only a few of the highest probability words are needed to reach this threshold.\n",
    "- **Double Limitation:** As a result, the sample size is doubly limited:\n",
    "  1. First by using the percentage of `top_p` to slice the list of probable words into a smaller subset.\n",
    "  2. In addition, the cumulative probability threshold further restricts the number of words that are considered since the running total of probabilities is reached quicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Higher `top_p` value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Larger Sample Size:** When `top_p` is high (e.g., 0.9), the model considers a much larger set of possible words.\n",
    "- **Slower Cumulative Probability Threshold:** The cumulative probability threshold (e.g., 0.9) is reached more slowly, allowing a larger number of words to be considered.\n",
    "- **Increased Diversity:** This larger sample size allows for more diversity in the generated text, as the model can choose from a wider range of words, including less probable ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, with a lower `top_p` value, the sample size is very small because it includes only the top probable words, and the cumulative probability threshold is reached quickly, further limiting the number of words considered. This results in highly deterministic and less diverse outputs.\n",

       "In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence, such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string. With each iteration, the loop performs a block of code with an item from the sequence. Here's a simple overview of how it works:\n",
       "\n",
       "### Syntax\n",
       "```python\n",
       "for variable in sequence:\n",
       "    # Code block to execute each time\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "- **variable**: This is a temporary variable that holds the current value of the sequence with each iteration.\n",
       "- **sequence**: This represents the collection of elements you want to iterate over.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example\n",
       "Let's look at a basic example to illustrate a for loop in action:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
       "for fruit in fruits:\n",
       "    print(fruit)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "In this example, the for loop goes through each element in the list `fruits`. With each iteration of the loop, the variable `fruit` takes on the value of the next element from the list. The `print(fruit)` line outputs the current fruit to the console.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Range Function\n",
       "The `range()` function is commonly used with `for` loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers. Here's how it works:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "for i in range(5):\n",
       "    print(i)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "This loop will output the numbers 0 to 4. By default, `range()` starts from 0 and goes up to, but does not include, the number specified in the function call.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Important Points\n",
       "- Indentation matters: Python relies on whitespace to denote the scope of code blocks, so the indented block of code is what's executed in the loop.\n",
       "- `for` loops in Python can iterate over any iterable object, including custom objects that implement the `__iter__()` method.\n",
       "\n",
       "By using `for` loops, you can dynamically and efficiently execute repetitive tasks over collections of data, making them an essential component of Python programming."
